# Description

This project is a multi-section landing page that demonstrates my ability to manipulate the DOM with Javascript.

# Usage

I designed my landing page as a guide through the resources that I used the most while learning Web Development for the first time. It includes all of my favorite guides and learning tools and includes every source that I used to develop this project.

# Development

The project was started initially with starter code provided by Udacity, but ultimately I decided to write my own HTML, CSS, and Javascript from scratch. This process can be tracked through my various commits.
